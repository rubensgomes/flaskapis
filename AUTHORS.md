# project

Rubens has designed and implemented the "flasapis" project an experimental /
learning playground to learn and experiment with an Internet-of-Things project involving a digital temperature sensor, Raspberry Pi and the Python language.

One of the REST APIs implemented by this project allows a back-end daemon to securelly (HTTPs) collect temperature sensor data from a digital sensor installed at Rubens living room in his apartment in Chapel Hill, NC.

In addition to the IoT project, Rubens also implemented a few utility RESTFul
API to convert temperatures, weights, and distances and so forth.

The REST APIs are documented at

http://restportal.com/

And the utility REST APIs are consumed by a mobile web app running at

http://appsgo.mobi/
